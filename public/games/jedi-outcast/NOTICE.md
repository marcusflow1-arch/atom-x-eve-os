jk2-web
=======

A browser / WebAssembly port of the single-player engine of Star Wars Jedi Knight II:
Jedi Outcast, built from Raven Software's original GPL source release.


COPYRIGHT AND LICENCE
---------------------

The engine sources under games/jk2/ are:

    Copyright (C) 2002 Activision / Raven Software
    Released by the copyright holder under the GNU General Public License, version 2.

    "This code is copyright Activision 2002. This source is released under GNU GPLv2."
      -- games/jk2/README.md, in the original drop

The port (everything outside games/jk2/ -- the Emscripten platform layer under
shared/wasm-build/sys_emscripten*/, the build scripts, the browser shell under play/,
the test harnesses, and the optional cloud backend) is likewise distributed under the
GNU General Public License, version 2. See LICENSE for the full text.

GPLv2, not GPLv3: the drop grants version 2 and does not include the customary "or (at
your option) any later version" clause for Raven's own code, so the combined work can
only be distributed under version 2. The only files in the drop carrying an "any later
version" grant are third-party components (the OpenAL headers and the mp3 decoder),
which does not extend to the engine as a whole.


GAME DATA IS NOT INCLUDED
-------------------------

No Jedi Outcast game assets are contained in, or distributed by, this repository. The
retail archives (assets0.pk3 and friends) are commercial content and are not
redistributable. To play you must supply your own legally-obtained copy, or use the
official free demo mission.

The .gitignore is written so that game data cannot be committed by accident, and the
published history has been checked to confirm none ever was.


TRADEMARKS
----------

STAR WARS and JEDI KNIGHT are trademarks of Lucasfilm Ltd. and/or its affiliates.
JEDI OUTCAST is a trademark of its respective owner. Activision and Raven Software are
trademarks of their respective owners. OpenAL and EAX are trademarks of Creative

THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS
----------------------

See `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md` for the components bundled in the original drop, their
licences, and which of them this port actually compiles.

Proprietary pre-compiled binaries that shipped inside the original drop (SmartHeap,
OpenAL, EAX, Immersion FeelIt and Bink Video .dll/.lib files) have been removed from
this repository. They are not GPL-licensed, are not required to build the WebAssembly
port, and redistributing them is not something the GPL grant covers. See
THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md for the complete list of what was removed.
